# ASG Coding Challenge
Telecom Phone APIs to manage phone related operations

## Info
This project is developed using Spring Boot, Spring data JPA, H2 and Mockito.

## Installation
To run simply start this up as a spring boot project or go to the CodingChallengeAsgApplication.java file and run it as a java program.

## Details
The application inserts some seed data during start up so that testing can be performed.
You can then perform 3 operations:
  1. Get all phone numbers - returns a list of all phone numbers in the system
  2. Get phone numbers for a customer - returns the list of phone numbers associated with a particular customer
  3. Activate a phone - activates the phone for the number passed
